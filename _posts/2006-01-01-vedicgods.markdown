Let's recall the forgotten gods and goddesses of India that are still remembered across the world.
Ushas ( ঊষা ) - The beautiful goddess of dawn. She is called Eos in Greek mythology and also the rosy-fingered goddess of dawn.

Parjanya ( পার্জন্য ) - The deity of rain. He is known as Perun in the Slavic countries, Perkon in Latvia, Perkunas in Lithuania.

Varuna ( বরুণ ) - In a distant past, he was the sky god. But now he is the god of oceans. In Greek mythology, his name is Ouranos ( Uranus ) who is the god of the skies.

Mitra ( মিত্র ) - He is the god of friendship and formal contracts. He is in Persian mythology, a sun god. In vedic mythology too, he is an Aditya ( sun ). The sons of 
Aditi are the suns. The twelve adityas (sun) rise throughout the year. Before Islam and Christianity, Mithraism was a dominant religion in the world.

Indra ( ইন্দ্র ) - He is the thunder god in the vedic pantheon who killed the dragon vrtra. Thus in the vedas, his epithet is vrtraghna ( slayer of vrtra ). In Persia, 
he is known as Verethragna which also means the same thing. He is equivalent to Zeus, Jupiter, Perun etc in power. In China and Buddhism, he is known as Sakra. In Japan,
he is worshipped as Taishakuten.

Dayuspitr ( দ্যুঃপিতৃ ) - Dayuspita or Dayuspitr is basically the same word as Jupiter ( djous + pater ) and Father Zeus. Djous/Dayus/Zeus mean দ্যুলোক বা sky. 
He is the father of Indra. From the word, Dayus/Divyos came the word day, deva, dev etc.

Saraswati ( সরস্বতী ) - Goddess of knowledge, art, learning. She is also the personification of the Harahvati river of Afghanistan. In Japan, she is worshipped as 
Benzaiten.

Kuber ( কুবের ) - God of wealth ( ধনকুবের ). In Japan, he is worshipped as Bishamon. His father’s name is Visravan ( বিশ্রবণ ), so he is called Vaisravan ( বৈশ্রবণ ).
But the Japanese cannot pronounce that. So his name has become Bishamon.

Yama ( যম ) - God of death, darkness and the underworld. In Persian mythology, he is called Jamshid/Yima ( জামশীদ ). In Japan, he is worshipped as Enma. 
In Japan, the word for darkness/night is yami ( যামী ).

Bhag ( ভগ ) - God of abundance. Bhag literally means wealth and abundance. Bhagaban means wealthy. The word Baghdad means “ভগদত্ত” which in turn means “given by god”.
