<strong>Problem Description:</strong> As in the figure above, $AB$ is a diameter of a circle with center $O$. $C$ is a point on $AB$ extended. A line through $C$ cuts the circle with center $O$ at $D, E. OF$ is a diameter of the circumcircle of $\triangle BOD$ with center $O_{1}$. Line $CF$ intersect the circumcircle again at $G$. Prove that $O,A,E,G$ are concyclic.
