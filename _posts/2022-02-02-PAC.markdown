<strong>Binary Classification Problem</strong>: Let's say, we have a domain $\mathcal{X}$ where each element $x = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n})$ is a $k$ size vector of features, a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathcal{X}$, and a label set $\mathcal{Y}$ so that there exists a bijective function $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$ such that $f(x) \in \mathcal{Y}$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$. We have a finite sample $S = ((x_{1}, y_{1}), (x_{2}, y_{2}), \cdots, (x_{m}, y_{m}))$ where each pair is an input output mapping from $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$.
