<strong>Solution:</strong>
Let's assume, $BE = X$. Connect $A$ with $E$. Draw a perpendicular line to $AE$ that intersects $DC$ at $F$. It's evident that all 4 triangles are right angled. The
only doubt that remains is whether $F$ is a lattice point or not. We choose $BE$ to be an integer. Since, $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle ECF$ are similar. We get,
