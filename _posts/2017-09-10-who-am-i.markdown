I am a <span style="color:blue;">lecturer</span> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <strong style="color:blue;">BRAC University, Bangladesh</strong>. I have graduated from the Department of Computer Science of <strong style="color:blue;">Dhaka University, Bangladesh</strong>. Before that, in a past life, I had the good fortune of representing my country in the <strong style="color:blue;">International Mathematical Olympiad in 2013</strong> and win an honorable mention. I also won a Bronze Medal at the <strong style="color:blue;">Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad, 2013</strong>. I was announced the <strong style="color:blue;">National Champion of the Champions</strong> by Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee in 2011.

Besides teaching, I spend my time in <strong style="color:blue;">research, reading books, digital illustrations and programming</strong>. My areas of interest in research are <strong style="color:blue;">Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Theory</strong>. Currently, I am working on <strong style="color:blue;">Combinatorial Bandits</strong>. My research interests also span <strong style="color:blue;">Representation Learning</strong> topics such as <strong style="color:blue;">Graph Representation Learning</strong>.

I am a student for life. I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I love to read about <strong style="color:blue;">mathematics, CS, history, mythology, religion, history of religions, anthropology, philology, philosophy, fantasy novels, science fictions</strong>. I also love travelling to foreign places. I love nature and animals. I endorse open-mindedness and tolerance.
