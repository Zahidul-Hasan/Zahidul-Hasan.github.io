I am a <strong>lecturer</strong> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <strong>BRAC University, Bangladesh</strong>. I have graduated from the Department of Computer Science of <strong>Dhaka University, Bangladesh</strong>. Before that, in a past life, I had the good fortune of representing my country in the <strong>International Mathematical Olympiad in 2013</strong> and win an honorable mention. I also won a Bronze Medal at the <strong>Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad, 2013</strong>. I was announced the <strong>National Champion of the Champions</strong> by Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee in 2011.

Besides teaching, I spend my time in <strong>research, reading books, digital illustrations and programming</strong>. My areas of interest in research are <strong>Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Theory</strong>. Currently, I am working on <strong>Combinatorial Bandits</strong>. My research interests also span <strong>Representation Learning</strong> topics such as <strong>Graph Representation Learning</strong>.

I am a student for life. I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I love to read about <strong>mathematics, CS, history, mythology, religion, religious history, anthropology, philology, philosophy, fantasy novels, science fictions</strong>. I also love travelling to foreign places. I love nature and animals. I endorse open-mindedness and tolerance.
